# Predictor App ðŸš€  

This is a simple Flutter-based **Predictor App** that generates crash points using a pattern-based algorithm.  

## Features  
âœ… Generates random crash points between **x1.0 â€“ x6.0**  
âœ… Sends crash points to **Firebase** (for communication with the game app)  
âœ… Simple **UI with a button** to trigger crash predictions  

## How It Works  
- Press the **"Predict Crash"** button  
- The app generates a **multiplier crash point**  
- The crash point is **sent to Firebase**  
- The game app reads the crash point and uses it
